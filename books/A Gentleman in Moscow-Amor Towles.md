# A Gentleman in Moscow
## Amor Towles
Delicious, charming, and uplifting story of an aristocrat under house arrest in the Metropol Hotel of Moscow during the Russian Revolution through the Cold War. You’ll love the Count for his misadventures, cleverness, positivity, erudition, and constantly eroding stubbornness in favor of an open heart towards those who surround him in his hotel. I hope to be as good of a friend and person as the Count - and I know I’ll be thinking of him and Sophia and Nina and the rest of his gang for a long time to come.
