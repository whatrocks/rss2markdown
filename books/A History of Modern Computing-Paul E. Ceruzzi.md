# A History of Modern Computing
## Paul E. Ceruzzi
A must-read for anyone who’s ever had a glimmer of nostalgia for a computer from their childhood, no matter if an IBM PC-clone, an Apple II, a Commodore VIC-20, or an Altair kit, and wondered where those magical devices came from. Is the computer a means of freedom or control? You’ll explore this theme throughout the book, beginning with modern computing’s punch-card origins in WW2 through IBM’s dominance in mainframes to the mini-computer and personal computer eras - leaving off just as the Internet and WWW begin to mature in the early 2000s (I anxiously await a volume three that will cover the last two decades - smartphones and cloud computing demand to be covered here) - and ultimately leaving that question as unanswered but hopeful.
