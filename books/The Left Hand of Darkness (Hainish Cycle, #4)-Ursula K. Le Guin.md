# The Left Hand of Darkness (Hainish Cycle, #4)
## Ursula K. Le Guin
A travelogue to another world - part diary, part folklore, part political thriller - by a lone emissary from an intergalactic civilization of humans, where Earth is only one of hundreds of human colonies, to encourage the people of Winter to join their union. But unlike the rest of the humans in this civilization, the people of Winter are genetically ambisexual, and this book catalogues our flawed narratorâ€™s path - both literal and figurative - towards understanding of the culture and people that emerged on a world without fixed sex or gender. His mistakes and mishaps and foibles, along with those of his strongest ally amongst the people of Winter, carry you through this book and drop you off again, ready to start it over immediately, to discover more of this planet and its people.
