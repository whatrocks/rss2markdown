# Falling Free (Vorkosigan Saga, #4)
## Lois McMaster Bujold
Tightly-packed, engineering-heavy, self-contained escape escapade with glimmers of a larger galactic military-industrial complex beyond. Frightening look at a potential bioengineering solution to the problems of prolonged zero-G - but luckily our humanity prevails. I have no idea right now how the quaddies will fit into the larger tale of the Miles Vorkosigan saga, but Iâ€™m sure excited to find out.
