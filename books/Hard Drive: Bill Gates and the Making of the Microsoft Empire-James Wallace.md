# Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire
## James Wallace
A portrait of wunderkind Bill Gates, written in the early 1990s, when Gates and his Microsoft stand on the peak that may become a precipice. Fascinating to learn about the origins and evolutions of Microsoft BASIC, MS-DOS, Windows, Excel, Word, and whatever else - as long as itâ€™s software (or a computer mouse). Will Microsoft survive the trials of the 1990s - only time will tell.
