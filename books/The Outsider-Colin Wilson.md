# The Outsider
## Colin Wilson
I have no idea when or why or purchased this book (perhaps found in an obscure Father Schall booklist?), but I knew I would find my way to reading it one day, so I kept it near, and I’m glad I did. Provides a literary and historical review of “Outsiders” - those artists and existentialists who struggle to reconcile their inner selves with the outer culture - with some scaffolding towards a religious salvation for them. I now see the Outsider in many things I’ve read, and I think my only advice would be that these Outsiders would all do well to read “Flow.”
