# Cloud Architecture Patterns: Using Microsoft Azure
## Bill Wilder
A short but sweet primer on making design decisions for cloud applications. There’s nothing groundbreaking in here, but that’s the point - the book reinforces well-trodden, effective patterns for scale, and doesn’t forget to outline the various trade-offs in any decision. These recommended patterns will become “eventually consistent” with your own instincts and ideas, with enough time.
