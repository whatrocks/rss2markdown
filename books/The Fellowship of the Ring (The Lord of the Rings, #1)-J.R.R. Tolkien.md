# The Fellowship of the Ring (The Lord of the Rings, #1)
## J.R.R. Tolkien
Worth every re-read. There’s so many more delightful bits of hobbit-lore and half-whispered memories of the lost kingdom of Arnor than I ever remembered - or appreciated as a middle-schooler during summer vacations, laying down on a couch next to a box fan, devouring both these books and chocolate teddy grams. I swear I even read the songs and poems this time, instead of just skipping anything in italics - I guess that’s called growing up.
