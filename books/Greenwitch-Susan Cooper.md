# Greenwitch
## Susan Cooper
A tiny sliver of a book that brings all the kids together for the first time - the Finders and the last of the Old Ones, all under the perfectly absentee watch of their Great Uncle Merry yet again. The Greenwitch fuses Welsh and Celtic folklore with the broader magic of the Dark is Rising series, and Iâ€™ll be heading to Wikipedia immediately after finishing them all to sort it out as best I can. This is another excellent book for a hazy summer day sitting directly next to a whirring box fan.
