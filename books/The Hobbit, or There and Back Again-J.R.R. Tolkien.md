# The Hobbit, or There and Back Again
## J.R.R. Tolkien
The most important book in my library, by far, discovered in the Scholastic Book Fair in fourth grade. I used to read this and LOTR once a year at the beginning of every summer, but havenâ€™t read it for at least fifteen years now. Read this book at once, read it again, read it aloud to a child, read at the beginning of a multi-day backpacking adventure in a foreign country, and always keep it in your backpack, just in case of something unexpected.
