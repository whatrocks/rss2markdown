# The Soul of a New Machine
## Tracy Kidder
Fantastic odyssey of bringing a new computer to life in the late 1970s. The metaphors and analogies for computer architecture are appropriate, approachable, and just plain awesome - I’ll be thinking about these explanations for a long time to come. Recommended for anyone who’s ever built anything with a computer and wants to go under the hood a bit deeper - no technical background required, but if you’ve got one, then you’ll dig this book even more.
