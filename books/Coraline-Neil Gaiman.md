# Coraline
## Neil Gaiman
A delightful and scary little story, perfect for a Halloween evening, summer campfire in the woods, or your routine #SundayScaries evening. Reminded me of my most favorite, most horrifying, and most retold tale in More Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark - The Drum. Be brave and go exploring with Coraline!
