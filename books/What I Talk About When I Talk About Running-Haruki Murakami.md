# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running
## Haruki Murakami
It feels good to do the work, to put in the time, to grind through to a flow state - whether that’s running or writing or whatever it is you’re seeking. This book is a tribute to Type 2 fun - the kind where it’s only fun in retrospect. My favorite part was learning the names of Japanese baseball teams - they are like poems from my dreams.
