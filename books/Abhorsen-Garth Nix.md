## Garth Nix
The adventure continues right where we left off in ‘Lirael’ - and doesn’t let up for a single moment. All your best friends are back in this one, from the Disreputable Dog to Sabriel to the Mogget, and I’m still left wanting more - of everything and everyone in the Old Kingdom. Even the tinkling call of Ranna couldn’t stop me from staying up late to finish this book, well past my bedtime, as this book should be read.
