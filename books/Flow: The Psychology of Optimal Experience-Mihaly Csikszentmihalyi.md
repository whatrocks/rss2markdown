# Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience
## Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
Once you start, you can’t stop reading this book. Flow is a framework for happiness in life, and this book explores all sorts of ways that people achieve flow - the “optimal experience” - from coding to sports to reading to friendship to work to everything in between. I’m filing this next to Nichomachean Ethics on my bookshelf.
