# If on a Winter's Night a Traveler
## Italo Calvino
A book of books about books. You’ll be ensnared before you know what’s happening, and then you never will, because something else, something here, is now happening and were you ever really there, before now? I don’t know, I’m just as confused, but I feel like I Get It Now.
