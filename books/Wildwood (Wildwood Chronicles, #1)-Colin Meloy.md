# Wildwood (Wildwood Chronicles, #1)
## Colin Meloy
Delicious romp through magical woods, replete with talking animals, friendly bandits, beautiful witches, Radio Flyers, and all things adventure. The illustrations are just as magic as the words. Even the book itself *feels* like something special, something that I would have devoured in my childhood bedroom, next to a whirring box fan, in the heat of summer.
