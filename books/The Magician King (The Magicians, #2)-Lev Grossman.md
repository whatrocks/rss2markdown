# The Magician King (The Magicians, #2)
## Lev Grossman
Adventure calls - how will you answer? And what will you give up, to join the quest, to be the hero? This nonstop, magic-fueled sequel is more meditative than its predecessor - yet delivers all the same happy-sad nostalgia feels of your favorite childhood books.
