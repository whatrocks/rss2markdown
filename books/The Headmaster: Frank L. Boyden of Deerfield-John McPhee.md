# The Headmaster: Frank L. Boyden of Deerfield
## John McPhee
A portrait of a leader. I’m always a sucker for anything about schools, and I badly want to go back and attend Boyden’s school to meet and learn from him and his wife. This is my second McPhee book, and I expect I’m now about to go deep down the McPhee rabbit hole of narrative non-fiction, and I couldn’t be happier about it.
