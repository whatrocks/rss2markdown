A terrifying look in the mirror for America and our interconnected world during a pandemic, so not exactly the escapism you might be hoping for at the moment, but I still couldn’t put it down for a single second. A true epic, a spiritual sequel to The Stand, a hilarious, moving, tragic take on our politics and technology. I can’t stop thinking about the ending, either.
