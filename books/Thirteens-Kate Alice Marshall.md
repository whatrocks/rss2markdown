## Kate Alice Marshall
A town with a curse, mysterious keys, an evil society, a spooky old house, monsters in the night, and three thirteen year old friends who might just be the heroes this town needs. Reminiscent of John Bellairs tales, this book is a the perfect spooky October read (or September, in my case). Full of action and also research in the town archives - my favorite kind of action.
