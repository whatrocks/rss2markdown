Kikoâ€™s journey to finding the strength she always held, amid abuse and anxiety and hopes and change. Her story - and the sketch descriptions at the end of each chapter - kept the pages turning, too quickly, as I learned about her growing up as a biracial Japanese American. And the love story throughout is sweet and strong and makes me happy.
