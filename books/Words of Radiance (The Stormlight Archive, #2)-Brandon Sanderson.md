# Words of Radiance (The Stormlight Archive, #2)
## Brandon Sanderson
Joy - that’s what this book brought me, along with The Thrill and a whole lotta Chulls. Book 2 is very much Shallan’s book, and I’m so glad for it - her journey and character arc kept me turning pages faster than I wanted to. And, of course, Bridge Four continues to be the best darn bunch of buddies there is, thank you very much, Stormfather.
