# Lirael (Abhorsen, #2)
## Garth Nix
Another book that I wished I’d read long before, because I know I’ll be thinking about Lirael and the Disreputable Dog for an even longer time. If you love books with giant libraries filled with hidden, locked, and forbidden doorways, then this is the book for you. I’ve heard the bells, and now I’m spellbound.
