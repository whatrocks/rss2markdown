# Born to Run
## Bruce Springsteen
A salt-water hymn to New Jersey, rock and roll, and the Promised Land beyond. Above all else, it becomes clear that Bruce has been saved by therapy, medication, and his loving marriage and children, and I’m even more grateful that he can still bring us his music and now his story. This lyrical sea shanty of a book dips and dives through Bruce’s roots, struggles, successes, continued struggles, and continued successes as a musician, friend, son, husband, father, and capital-H human, and he delivers, every step of the way.
