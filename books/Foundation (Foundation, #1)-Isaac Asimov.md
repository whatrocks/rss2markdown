# Foundation (Foundation, #1)
## Isaac Asimov
The seeds of a new galactic empire, hidden in a encyclopedic project. There’s more to be discovered in the future, even if Hari Seldon has it all figured out. As soon as you like a character, it’s time to move on - maybe this is a Seldon crisis in itself.
