# Darius the Great Is Not Okay (Darius The Great, #1)
## Adib Khorram
I fell right into Darius’s Vans, and Sohrab’s borrowed cleats, as he explored his family’s past and present in a trip to Iran to visit his grandparents. Friendship and acceptance and communication and love and depression and growing up and soccer and tea and Lord of the Rings and Star Trek abound in this book. A good friend is a mighty thing indeed.
