# Dog Man
## Dav Pilkey
A gripping origin tale of a man with a dogâ€™s head sewn to his body who fights crime and likes to do other dog stuff, too. Filled with super cute illustrations of hot dogs that come to life and try to take over the world. And how could I almost forget to mention the Flip-O-Ramas!!
