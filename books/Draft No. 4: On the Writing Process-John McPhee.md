# Draft No. 4: On the Writing Process
## John McPhee
A taste of what it might be like to take McPhee’s Creative Nonfiction course at Princeton, in another perfect little paperback. I’ll keep collecting his books, but I need to slow down and savor them instead of racing to the next one. Until then, in this meta-McPhee, I learned a bit more about he structures his stories, and chooses what to include, and how he captures memories, and how he seems to have a damn good time while doing it.
