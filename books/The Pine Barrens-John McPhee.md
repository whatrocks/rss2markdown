# The Pine Barrens
## John McPhee
A perfect little dream-memory-yarn about the mysterious Pine Barrens of New Jersey, and the people who love them. This is the redemption story for New Jersey we’ve been waiting for, one that we’ve had all along, but were already losing 50 years ago. This book is delightful and intelligent and sweet and dreamy and magic in a way that constantly reminds me why I love reading - and my home state - so much.
