# Wake of Vultures (The Shadow, #1)

I utterly devoured the tale of Nettie Lonesome becoming ... whatever it is she damn well pleases, while also, you know, fulfilling her monster-hunting destiny. Hilarious and heart-wrenching, with every chapter packing an punch to the gut and brain and heart and eyeball holes. I’m also glad to finally learn what to do when your coworkers turn into chupacabras: hint, they’re not going to like it.
