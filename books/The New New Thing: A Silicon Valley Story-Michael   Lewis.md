# The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story
## Michael   Lewis
Lewis and Clark cross the Atlantic, this time using Clark’s automated sailboat powered by 25 Silicon Graphics computer workstations and a million lines of C++. Things don’t quite go as planned, and yet that feels right on target for Jim Clark and his always-moving, ever-restless entrepreneurial adventures. This old old book still feels new new new in 2020, and should be required beach reading for anyone in tech.
