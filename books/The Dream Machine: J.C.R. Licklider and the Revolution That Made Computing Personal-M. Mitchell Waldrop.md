# The Dream Machine: J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution That Made Computing Personal
## M. Mitchell Waldrop
Lick’s battle against HAL 9000 towards human-computer symbiosis is the computer history book we don’t deserve. Imagination, creativity, collaboration, bravery, exploration, freedom, ideas mostly win over bureaucracy in the battle for the soul of computers, in many parts thanks to Lick’s vision and purse strings while at ARPA. Reading about the past promise of computers and humans together reinvigorates my hopes for their future.
