# Seven Surrenders (Terra Ignota, #2)
## Ada Palmer
Read this book. And then re-read it. That way you’ll understand what’s unraveling all around Mycroft Canner. At least that’s what I’m hoping happens for me. Among its other positive qualities, this book (series) has the best character names in the business. I’m sad and happy after finishing this book, and isn’t that the best outcome for just about anything?
