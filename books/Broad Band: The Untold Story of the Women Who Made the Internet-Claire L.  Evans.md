# Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet
## Claire L.  Evans
An inside look at the women who programmed, coded, designed, and built the foundations of software engineering, mainframe computing, hypertext, the ARPANET, social networking, and online communities. I particularly enjoyed learning about Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler - who has been absent from my readings on the ARPANET to date - and her role in organizing the ARPANET directory prior to DNS. I also loved the motto of Purple Moon games, and the story of their founder Brenda Laurel.
