# The Return of the King
## J.R.R. Tolkien
What a year it’s been for Frodo and Company. The Scouring of the Shire remains my favorite — and therefore the best — chapter of the last two books, and yet I’m still glad it wasn’t in the movies (because it makes a re-read that much more satisfying). Do not be sad that our Quest is over, even though Gandalf said it’s alright to cry, because there’s always next summer vacation to read it all over again.
