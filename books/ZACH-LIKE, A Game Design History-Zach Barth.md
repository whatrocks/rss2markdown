# ZACH-LIKE, A Game Design History
## Zach Barth
Stroll through the Zachtronics memory palace, where no idea or fever dream for a game is left behind or forgotten. I’ve heard that learning by teaching is the mark of understanding, but learning by making a game may be the greater insight. You’ll leave this book inspired - and possibly calling your parents to unearth your old notebooks for long lost video game doodles.
