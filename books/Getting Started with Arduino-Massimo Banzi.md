# Getting Started with Arduino
## Massimo Banzi
A bite-sized (byte-sized?) dive into the world of physical computing with Arduino - written by its creator. Approachable for all coding skill levels, the book provides a few simple projects along the way to get you up and running with some nice blinking LEDs - and inspires you to dream of even more. I would have liked to see more detailed diagrams for the placement of items on the breadboard, which was a bit hard to interpret, but the book encourages trial and error, so I guess itâ€™s all part of the master plan.
