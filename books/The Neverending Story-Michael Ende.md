# The Neverending Story
## Michael Ende
I’m overwhelmed by the experience of reading this book. From the magical green and purple fonts distinguishing Fantastica and our world to the stunning chapter frontispieces to the gut-wrenching friendship of Bastian, Atreyu, and Falkor, this book is special and I’ll be returning again and again and again. “Shardik” by Richard Adams is the closest comparison I can make, except The Neverending Story offers hope and goodness.
