# Red Rising (Red Rising Saga, #1)
## Pierce Brown
This is my bookReview of Darrowâ€™s simultaneous revenge, coming of age, and love stories. If you like greekMythology, schoolRivalries, medievalWeaponry, and camelCase, then this is book for you. Slow burner in the beginning, but great pacing and plot surprises barreled me through the second half, much like a runaway Helldiver losing control beneath the surface of the red planet.
