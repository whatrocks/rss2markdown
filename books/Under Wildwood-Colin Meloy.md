# Under Wildwood
## Colin Meloy
Back into the woods we go with Prue and Curtis (and, of course, Septimius the Rat). The world of Wildwood expands, unwinds, and goes deeper than we ever knew in this delightfully long book, and looks to be setting up for an epic last battle in book three. OH, HOW COULD I FORGET TO MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVED THE CITY OF MOLES?
